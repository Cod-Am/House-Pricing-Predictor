The model intends to predict house prices. 5 features were used train the model namely, area (square feet), number of bedrooms, type of neighborhood, and the year it was built in. The model had got a large root mean square error and hence it has a very low accuracy. Scatterplots were used to visualize the error. The project is still under development. Strings were converted to int using label encoders. 7 algorithms were used for training the model, among them MLP Regressor performed the best.
